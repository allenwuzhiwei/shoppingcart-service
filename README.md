# ðŸ›’ ShoppingCart MicroService - E-commerce Backend Module

## Overview

The **ShoppingCart Service** is a foundational microservice within our e-commerce platform.  
It is responsible for managing shopping cart lifecycle operations, such as creating shopping carts, adding items, updating quantities, and clearing cart contents.

It is built with **Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA**, and integrates with other services such as Order Service through REST APIs or Feign clients (to be implemented).

## Project Structure

The `shoppingcart-service` project follows a clean **Spring Boot + JPA** architecture,  
with clear separation of concerns across configuration, controller, service, repository, and entity layers.

- `config/`  
  âž¤ API response model, global exception handler, Swagger config, and basic security configuration.

- `controller/`  
  âž¤ Exposes RESTful endpoints for shopping cart operations (view, add, update, delete).

- `dto/`  
  âž¤ Defines request payload objects for adding and updating cart items (e.g. `AddCartRequest`, `UpdateCartRequest`).

- `entity/`  
  âž¤ Domain model classes that map to database tables: `ShoppingCart` and `CartItem`.

- `repository/`  
  âž¤ Spring Data JPA repositories for `ShoppingCart` and `CartItem`.

- `service/` and `service/impl/`  
  âž¤ Business logic for shopping cart management (lazy cart creation, quantity merging, total calculation).

- `resources/`  
  âž¤ Configuration file (`application.properties`) and Spring Boot resource folder.

- `ShoppingCartApplication.java`  
  âž¤ The main entry point of the Spring Boot application.

- `pom.xml`  
  âž¤ Maven configuration with required dependencies.
